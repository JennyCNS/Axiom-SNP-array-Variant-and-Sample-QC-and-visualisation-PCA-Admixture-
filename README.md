# Axiom-SNParray-Variant-and-Sample-QC-and-visualisation #
This repository provides the basic steps to export genotyping data from the Axiom Analysis Suite as well as it's manipulation using plink and population structure visualisation in the form of PCA's and Admixture plots.

# Axiom Analysis Suite#

The [Axas](https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis/microarray-analysis-instruments-software-services/microarray-analysis-software/axiom-analysis-suite.html) is a free-access software developed by ThermoFisher Scientific to analyse genotyping data generated by Axiom microarrays. 

# Generating genotype data from Axas

Whilst the software provides standard parameters for sample and array QC, it is possible to extract genotypes from all individuals and filter them manually using [plink](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950838/). For this, genotyping data must be exported in plink PED, without specifying thresholds to the sample and marker CR. This will generate two files: a ".map" and ".ped" which must be imported to the HPC for furhter analysis.

# Screening for Sample CR in plink #

Once the files have been imported to the HPC the sample CR can be explored using plink.
first, to explore data missingess within individuals and markers, we'll run the command:

---
plink --file (yourfilename) --missing 
---

This command will generate two files:
.imiss (individual missingness)
.lmiss (marker missingness)
